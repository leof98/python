Day 2 Project - Tip Calculator <
-We're going to build a tip calculator.
-If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
-Each person should pay:
-(150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
-After formatting the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
'''

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 ")) / 100 + 1
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
total = round(bill * tip / people, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${total}")
