# Python Projects Repository  

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! This is where I store my Python programming exercises and projects, categorized into two main sections based on courses and bootcamps Iâ€™ve completed.  

## About  

This repository showcases my progress and learning in Python programming through:  

1. **100 Days of Code**: A Python bootcamp focusing on practical projects and daily challenges.  
2. **CS50P**: Harvardâ€™s *Introduction to Computer Science with Python*, a free course covering foundational programming concepts.  

## Structure  

The repository is organized into two main folders:  

- **`100-days-of-code/`**:  
  Contains all the projects and challenges from the "100 Days of Code" bootcamp.  
  Topics include:  
  - Data structures and algorithms.  
  - Python libraries like Pandas, Flask, etc.  
  - Real-world programming scenarios, including working with APIs and file systems. 

- **`cs50p/`**:  
  Contains all the assignments and projects from Harvardâ€™s *CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science with Python*.  
  Topics include:  
  - Core programming concepts like loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.  
  - Problem-solving through algorithms and data structures.  

## Tools and Libraries  

Throughout these projects, Iâ€™ve used:  

- **Python**: For all coding tasks and projects.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and explanations (where applicable).  
- **External Libraries**: Such as Pandas, Flask, Matplotlib, and more (depending on the project).  

## How to Use  

Feel free to browse the repository and use the code for educational purposes. Each folder contains detailed subdirectories with README files for specific projects, explaining their purpose and implementation.  

## Contributing
